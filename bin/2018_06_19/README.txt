Create a random forest model to predict enhancer overlap with transposable elements based on
the presence of transcription factors within transposable elements. Use cross validation
on the model. Split into train/test to create predictions and get metrics. Training set is
ovesampled or undersampled because original data has mostly 0's in prediction vector (no overlap).
