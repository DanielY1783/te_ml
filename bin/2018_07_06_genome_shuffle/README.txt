kmer_counter_batch, data_splitter, and data_combiner are repurposed from 
/dors/capra_lab/users/yand1/te_ml/bin/2018_07_03_pca_te_enhancers

First file splits
/dors/capra_lab/users/yand1/te_ml/data/2018_07_06_genome_shuffle/all_pairs.tsv
for batch processing, second file counts the kmers within the split files, and the third file combines the split kmer count files into one features matrix.
